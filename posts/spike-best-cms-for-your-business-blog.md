### Starting a business blog?

Wondering how to pick the best CMS (Content Management System) for it?

If your small business is already investing into channels like direct marketing or PPC, you don’t need to abandon those entirely. In fact, you can build a cohesive marketing strategy that integrates all marketing channels (online and offline) and funnels everything back to your website. The end goal should always be to drive the most eyes to your website as you can.

Blogging as a business is a great way to increase the number of searches your site appears for, which means it has inherent SEO value. In fact, businesses that have a blog generate 434% more indexed pages in search engines like Google and Bing. The more pages you have indexed, the more likely your site is to show up when someone searches for a relevant term.

Deciding to start a business blog is easy. Executing it is where the trouble comes in. Before you ever launch a blog, you need to decide on a content management system (CMS) which will make your life easier as you start publishing content.

### Drupal for Your Business Blog

If you’re looking for a free CMS platform and aren’t sure about WordPress, then your next best option might be Drupal. Many people compare Drupal to WordPress because of their similarities; both are free platforms, open source, have thousands of plugins, and communities of developers and support.

However, Drupal does have advantages that make it worth considering as a CMS for your business blog. Drupal offers much more complex solutions than WordPress.

Its functionality does require some moderate knowledge in development, but the results are far more advanced than what can be easily accomplished in WordPress. For instance, if your business blog needs an array of page templates and content types, then you would probably like Drupal better.

The biggest advantage to using Drupal for your blog is the security features that come with the CMS. While all CMS solutions have some security features, Drupal has one of the strongest. In fact, Drupal is the CMS of choice for the White House’s website (whitehouse.gov) as well as many other government organizations.

So, if your blog needs unique functionality or a steel-curtain security layer, Drupal would probably be the CMS of choice.

### Joomla for Your Business Blog

Joomla is considered a great content management system for small businesses because of its ease to develop and how customizable it is to your needs. In fact, Harvard University built their website on the Joomla platform.

Much like the other two mentioned above, Joomla is also open-source, meaning there are a lot of applications and templates readily available. As found in the infographic below, Joomla has 1,000 free themes and 7,000 free plugins. While this isn’t quite as much as WordPress or Drupal, it is still enough for most small businesses to operate their blog with.

### Why Is WebriQ CMS the Best CMS for Your Business?

Roots and Spike are very good at helping to build static front-ends. It is sponsored heavily by Carrot Creative, and makes frequent, highly variable builds quicker and easier for freelancers and agencies. It's a truly excellent framework for quickly and easily building small to medium sized front-ends of any kind. Roots can handle a huge number of compiled languages, and can be used with many tools that help push static sites as far as possible. For example, it can link with an API, pull in your data, and render parts of it into your views on compile. Then it can render the same or other views as javascript templates and you can push any other data from your API into them on the fly at runtime on the client side in reaction to user actions. And that's just a small taste of its capabilities. You really can do a lot with static sites, and roots is here to push those limits.
